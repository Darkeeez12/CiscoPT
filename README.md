# CiscoPT

This project presents a comprehensive, multi-floor campus LAN network infrastructure designed and simulated using Cisco Packet Tracer. The objective was to create a scalable and robust network to support a diverse user base, including academic staff, administrative personnel, and students.

Key Features:
- Star-Topology Design: The network utilizes a star-topology, linking individual departmental switches to a centralized core switch and router to ensure efficient data flow and management.

- Hybrid IP Addressing: A hybrid addressing scheme was implemented, featuring manual static IPs for every network devices (mainly PCs) and a dynamically managed DHCP pool for end-user devices and two dummy PC, optimizing both control and scalability.

- On-Premises Services: On-premises servers (including DHCP, Apache web, and SMTP/IMAP mail) were deployed to provide essential network services, ensuring seamless service discovery and high availability within the campus environment.

- Network Validation: The design was carefully tested and validated through Packet Tracer simulations, confirming stable connectivity without any device left alone, minimal packet loss, and consistent low latency across the network.
